# CSCI 466 PA2 - Bit Board Storage

## Instructions


Complete the following assignment individually.
Submit your work on D2L into the "Programming Assignment 2" folder. 


## Learning Objectives

In this programming assignment you will:

- Implement a class to store the setup board as bits. The core functionality of your class will be implemented in the
 Netwide Assembler (NASM).


## Overview

Your objective is to extend your basic implementation of the 
[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)) 
game to store the player setup boards in two dimensional bit arrays.
The core of the idea is that the `Server` reads in the player setup boards and instead of referencing the file to
 evaluate each shot, it saves the board in internal memory.
You might wonder why not store the board in a two dimensional vector?
Well, since all we want to store is whether a ship is present in a given position, using a vector, even just of bytes, still uses 8 bits for every ship position. 
We want to get this down to one bit.
Of course you could use something like an array of [bitsets](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/bitset/bitset/), but
 you can save even more memory by implementing a two dimensional bit storage yourself in assembly.
For very large data sets, or on very memory-constrained devices, every bit counts!

To complete this assignment you will extend your current implementation of Battleship.
I have added some functions that you'll need to implement, but most of your `Server` code should carry over. 
Your `Client` code will remain unchanged.
I have also added a few tests to check the new functionality, while keeping all the old tests in tact.
So, if you have those working, great! 
If not, you can earn back some points by getting your code to pass the tests you missed in PA1.


## Program Invocation

To play Battleship you should first start the server by running the `run-server` executable.
Then start the player clients by running two instances of the `run-client` executable.
Unfortunately, the client and server executables will not do anything interesting until you implement `Client.cpp` 
and `Server.cpp`.
As you progress in these implementations, your code will pass more and more tests in `tests.cpp`.
When your code passes all the tests, you will be able to run the client and server executables to play the game.


## Bonus 

I will award __one bonus point__ for each of the following:  

* Server sends a different result when a ship is sunk. The client implementation notifies the player when they sink a
 ship (implementation and tests). 
 This will require you to store more than 1 bit in the setup board array - you will also need to store ship type.


## What to Submit

Submit your work on D2L into the "Programming Assignment 2" folder. 

* A text file containing a link to a GitHub repository with your solution for the base assignment.
Please not that your repository should be private, so that other students cannot see your solutions.
You can create an unlimited number of private repositories by upgrading your github account to the pro version for
 free using the [academic discount](https://help.github.com/en/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount) with your school email.
In order for us to be able to see your solution, please add github users `cooperstrahan` and `mwittie` as
 collaborators through repository settings.

* If you implement the bonus solution, please submit a YouTube video of your implementation. 
Be sure to show the tests you have written as well as your assembly code.


## Grading 

We will grade your submissions based on how many test cases in `tests.cpp` your solution passes.
